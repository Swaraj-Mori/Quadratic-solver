This is a program I made when I was in 10th grade. I had homework to solve a lot of quadratic equations, so I made this to solve it for me.
This can only solve for quadratic equations in one variable, of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
It gives roots, discriminant and nature of roots.
It will give roots in complex form x + iy, if roots are imaginary.
It gives roots in fractional form rather than converting into decimal (only if result is not an integer), it will do this for both real part and imaginary part. It does this because this is how I was suppose to write in my homework.
And I made this without use of any external modules or libraries, just python.
It is not meant to be an advanced mathematical tool, I just made it out of boredom.
You can use this to do your homework too.
