It is fairly easy to use.
It can only solve for QUADRATIC EQUATIONS for ONE VARIABLE.
Suppose equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0, then prompt the program a, b and c as it asks.
It will give discrimant (b^2 + 4ac), Nature of roots and ofcourse the roots.
After one use it will ask whether to go on or not, just type 1 to continue and 0 to not.
